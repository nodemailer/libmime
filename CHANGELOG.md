-   Experimental support for node-iconv

## v4.0.1 2018-07-24

-   Maintenance release. Bumped deps

## v4.0.0 2018-06-11

-   Refactored decoding of mime encoded words and parameter continuation strings

## v3.0.0 2016-12-08

-   Updated encoded-word generation. Previously a minimal value was encoded, so it was possible to have multiple encoded words in a string separated by non encoded-words. This was an issue with some webmail clients that stripped out the non-encoded parts between encoded-words so the updated method uses wide match by encoding from the first word with unicode characters to the last word. "a =?b?= c =?d?= e" -> "a =?bcd?= e"

## v2.0.3 2016-02-29

-   Fixed an issue with rfc2231 filenames

## v2.0.2 2016-02-11

-   Fixed an issue with base64 mime words encoding

## v2.0.1 2016-02-11

Updated encoded word encoding with quoted printable, should be more like required in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047#section-5

## v1.0.0 2015-04-15

Changed versioning scheme to use 1.x instead of 0.x versions. Bumped dependency versions, no actual code changes.

## v0.1.7 2015-01-19

Updated unicode filename handling â€“ only revert to parameter continuation if the value actually includes
non-ascii characters or is too long. Previously filenames were encoded if they included anything
besides letters, numbers, dot or space.

## v0.1.6 2014-10-25

Fixed an issue with `encodeWords` where a trailing space was invalidly included in a word if the word
ended with an non-ascii character.

## v0.1.5 2014-09-12

Do not use quotes for continuation encoded filename parts. Fixes an issue with Gmail where the Gmail webmail keeps the charset as part of the filename.
